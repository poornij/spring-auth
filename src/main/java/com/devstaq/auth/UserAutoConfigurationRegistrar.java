/**
 * {@code UserAutoConfigurationRegistrar} dynamically registers the base package of this library with Spring Boot to ensure that its entities,
 * repositories, and other Spring-managed components are properly detected and included in the application context.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to simplify the integration of the library into Spring Boot applications by automatically registering the library's base
 * package (<i>com.devstaq.auth</i>) for component scanning. It ensures that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The library's repositories and entities are discovered and configured correctly.</li>
 * <li>The consuming application retains its ability to automatically detect its own repositories and entities.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This approach avoids the need for the consuming application to manually specify the library's base package or manage complex configuration,
 * reducing setup effort and minimizing potential errors.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This solution leverages {@link AutoConfigurationPackages#register} to dynamically register the library's package during the
 * auto-configuration phase, ensuring compatibility with Spring Boot's component scanning and auto-configuration mechanisms.
